A blazingly fast and memory efficient tracing frontend.

== How it works
To explain the idea behind `clltk` it is best to break down a small example:
[source,C,linenums]
----
CLLTK_TRACEBUFFER(MyFirstTracebuffer, 1024);

int main()
{
  const char * name = "Max";
  const int age = 42;

  CLLTK_TRACEPOINT(MyFirstTracebuffer, "Hello %s, you are %d years old", name, age);

  return 0
}
----

=== Tracebuffer creation
`clltk` 's main concept are *Tracebuffers*, in which tracing data is stored. This allows tight control over memory consumption of the traces:

`CLLTK_TRACEBUFFER(MyFirstTracebuffer, 1024);`

Creates a new *Tracebuffer* with a size of at least 1024 bytes. This Tracebuffer will automatically be constructed at program start before entering `main()`.

A *Tracebuffer* actually refers to two parts:

1. The actual buffer, holding *Tracepoint* entries. +
   In the backend this buffer is most likely implemented as a ringbuffer.
2. A set of memory sections holding metadata

NOTE: The `clltk` library does not manage buffer memory itself. Instead you will need a data store backend which can allocate buffer memory and provide access to it.

=== Tracepoint creation
In the application code you can create *Tracepoints* whose entries and metadata will be sent into the associated *Tracebuffer*. This is done by using the line

`CLLTK_TRACEPOINT(MyFirstTracebuffer, "Hello %s, you are %d years old", name, age);`

This allows printf-style formatting and type-checking of Tracepoint arguments.
When you use this macro, three things happen:

1. **At compile time:**
   Metadata for the tracepoint is collected, such as FormatString, Argument Types, Line Number and Filename. Those are stored in a custom section of the compiled ELF file.
2. **When program loads:**
   Stores FormatString and other Metadata to the Tracebuffer's metadata.
3. **When program execution traverses this point:**
    Encodes and Stores an Entry into the Tracebuffer containing
    - A reference into the Tracepoint metadata (containing FormatString)
    - Dynamic data given as variable argument list (`name` and `age`)
    - Additional Metadata, such as `timestamp` or `processId`

NOTE: By splitting the work into those three stages, `clltk` is able to reduce memory consumption of Tracebuffer space and increase runtime performance, at the cost of slightly higher program startup time.

== Storage Backends
*CLLTK* takes care of effectively encoding Tracepoint data. Where and how those Tracepoints, as well as metadata is stored is the job of the *Storage Backend*. +
For example, data could be stored either lossless or lossy (in Ringbuffers), in a global database, in files, or streamed over the network.

Typically a Backend also supports exporting trace data into a serialized format and reading this format back.

=== Storage Backend Interface
The interface a Storage Backend needs to fulfill is documented link:./storage_backend.asciidoc[here]

=== How to couple CLLTK with a Backend
The backend is selected by simply linking against a library, which exports the functions described in the backend interface.

=== Simple File storage Backend
*CLLTK* ships with a very simple example backend. This backend stores each tracebuffer as a file `buffername.dump`. Associated metadata gets stored as `buffername.meta.dump`.


== Trace Entry Data Format
The data format in which traces are serialized is described in detail in the link:./technical_documentation.asciidoc[CLLTK Technical] documentation.

*CLLTK* ships with a decoder, which can decode trace entries. A decoded entry will look like this:

----
TODO: Decoded example
----

NOTE: *CLLTK* does not describe how tracebuffers are stored. The decoder relies on the backend to provide access to trace entries.

== The `CLLTK_TRACEPOINT` Macro Syntax
----
CLLTK_TRACEPOINT(_BUFFER_, _FORMAT_, ...)
----
_BUFFER_:: Named Identifier of an already defined CLLTK_TRACEBUFFER
_FORMAT_:: A valid C String Literal (null terminated `const char*`). Not a variable. For supported format specifiers in the given String, see chapter <<format_specifiers>>
... (Variable Argument List):: Arguments with which the format specifiers will be replaced in formatted output. Supported Argument types are listed in chapter <<argument_types>>

=== Compatibility with `printf` format specifiers [[format_specifiers]]
All standard format specifiers are supported. For a comprehensive list, have a look http://www.pixelbeat.org/programming/gcc/format_specs.html[here].

However note the following special cases:

* `%.10s` will still capture the whole string, and not only 10 characters.
* `%.\*s` will still capture the whole string, together with argument value for `*`.

=== Supported argument data types in Variable Argument List [[argument_types]]
* signed / unsigned
* const / non-const
* 8, 16, 32, 64 and 128 bits
* float (32bits) and double (64bits)
* string (NULL terminated)

== Dynamic Tracebuffer API
In addition to the static `CLLTK_TRACEBUFFER` macro, CLLTK provides a dynamic API for runtime tracebuffer management:

=== Creating a Tracebuffer at Runtime
[source,C]
----
clltk_dynamic_tracebuffer_creation(const char *buffer_name, size_t size);
----
Creates a new tracebuffer with the specified name and size at runtime. This is useful when the tracebuffer name or size needs to be determined dynamically.

=== Clearing a Tracebuffer at Runtime
[source,C]
----
clltk_dynamic_tracebuffer_clear(const char *buffer_name);
----
Clears all entries from the specified tracebuffer. The tracebuffer remains allocated and can continue to receive new tracepoints.

=== Dynamic Tracepoints
[source,C]
----
CLLTK_DYN_TRACEPOINT(_BUFFER_, _FORMAT_, ...)
----
Similar to `CLLTK_TRACEPOINT`, but for use with dynamically created tracebuffers.

== Command Line Tool
The `clltk` command line tool provides several commands for working with tracebuffers:

=== Clear Command
The `clear` command removes all entries from a tracebuffer:
----
clltk clear <buffer_name>
----
This is useful for resetting a tracebuffer without restarting the application.

== CLLTK Decoder
[source,C,linenums]
----
    struct clltk_decoded_entry
    {
        //comparable to trace_point + filled out format string
    }

    //-----------------------------
    // Decoder interface not part of backend:
    // returns static error message. nullptr if success.
    const char * clltk_decode_entry(
        size_t metadata_blob_count,
        backend_metadata_blob metadata_blobs[metadata_blob_count],
        void * entry_data,
        size_t entry_size,
        void * callback_environment,
        void (callback_decoded_entry*)(const clltk_decoded_entry * const decoded_entry, void * environment)
    )
