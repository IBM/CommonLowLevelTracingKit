== Naming

[cols="1,5"]
|===
h| name h| meaning 
| tracebuffer |
    From file point of view the whole tracebuffer, consisting of definition, ringbuffer and stack. 
    And from tracing library point of view, everything related to one tracebuffer. 
| tracepoint | 
    A line of code inside user code to trace program execution and values. It is fixed (compile time) associated with a tracebuffer. It consisted of meta data, created at compile time, which are placed inside the stack of tracebuffer and a function call which created, if tracepoint is executed, a ringbuffer entry. 
| traceentry | A entry inside a ringbuffer with argument values and, if required, meta information.
| ringbuffer | Ringbuffer for flexible-size ringbuffer entries. Will automatically drop oldest entry if full.
| metaentry | meta information for one trace point with information like format string, file name, line number, argument types
| metablob | multiple meta entries which are combined into a elf-section. And is part of the binary of a traced application or an entry in stack of a tracebuffer.
| trace point call | user application traverse source code and hits trace point
| user arguments | arguments in trace point call
| format string | compile-time constant printf-like format string
| trace context | values like timestamp, process id, thread id
| user application | software which is traced
| snapshot | very fast copy of one or more trace buffers at one point in time
| decoding time |
| runtime |
| compile time |
|traced application |
| file section |
| elf section |

=== Ringbuffer Operations

==== ringbuffer_clear

[source,C]
----
void ringbuffer_clear(ringbuffer_head_t *rb);
----

Clears all entries from the ringbuffer. This is an O(1) operation that works by setting `last_valid = next_free`, effectively marking all existing entries as invalid without physically erasing them. Additionally, the `dropped` counter is updated to equal the `entries` counter, reflecting that all previously recorded entries have been discarded.

This function is used internally when a tracebuffer needs to be reset at runtime without deallocating or recreating the underlying memory structures.

=== Public API

==== clltk_dynamic_tracebuffer_clear

[source,C]
----
void clltk_dynamic_tracebuffer_clear(const char *buffer_name);
----

Clears a tracebuffer at runtime by name. This function provides a public interface for clearing all entries from an existing tracebuffer.

.Behavior
* Opens the existing tracebuffer specified by `buffer_name`
* Does *not* create the tracebuffer if it does not exist
* Acquires the tracebuffer lock to ensure thread-safe operation
* Clears the ringbuffer using `ringbuffer_clear()`
* Releases the lock and any allocated resources

.Parameters
[cols="1,3"]
|===
| `buffer_name` | The name of the tracebuffer to clear
|===

.Usage Example
[source,C]
----
// Clear an existing tracebuffer named "my_buffer"
clltk_dynamic_tracebuffer_clear("my_buffer");
----

== Used technicals tricks in Implementation
=== printf-format check
To ensure valid argument-types for a format-string,
link:https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-3.2/gcc/Function-Attributes.html#:~:text=format%20(archetype%2C%20string%2Dindex%2C%20first%2Dto%2Dcheck)[gcc format attribute] is used. 
To activate this check `-Wall` as compile flag is required.
Than it could be used like this: 

[source,C,linenums]
----
// function declaration
void printf_like_function(void *receiver, const char *format, ...)
    __attribute__ ((format (printf, 2, 3)));

// function call
printf_like_function(receiver, "%d", 1);       // ok
printf_like_function(receiver, "%s", "1");     // ok
printf_like_function(receiver, "%s", 1);       // gcc warning [-Wformat]
printf_like_function(receiver, "%d", 1.1);     // gcc warning [-Wformat]
printf_like_function(receiver, "%f", 1);       // gcc warning [-Wformat]
printf_like_function(receiver, "%d", (long)1); // gcc warning [-Wformat]
----

=== Type safe access to variable arguments
1. get argument count and array with argument-types as enums, through link:https://stackoverflow.com/a/11920694[c-macro-magic], at compile-time. Use `_Generic` macro to map types to enum and use meta programming for c++.
2. use argument type array to access var_list with with valid type

---

=== Gathering meta data at compile-time
To get all meta data for one tracebuffer, all relevant information are stored in to a custom elf-section. This is possible due to a  
link:https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-3.2/gcc/Function-Attributes.html#:~:text=section%20(%22section%2Dname%22)[gcc section attribute].
By defining all meta data strings and data structures as `static const` and applying the section attribute, gcc will gathering all meta data into the same section. 

[source,C,linenums]
----

// in first_file.cpp
{
    static const char filename[] __attribute__((used, section("my_section"))) = {__FILE__};
    static const char format[] __attribute__((used, section("my_section"))) = {"first format string %s"};
}

// second_file.cpp
{
    static const char filename[] __attribute__((used, section("my_section"))) =  {__FILE__};
    static const char format[] __attribute__((used, section("my_section"))) =  {"second format string %d"};
}

/* elf section "my_section" 
.filename_0 "first_file.cpp\0"
.format_0 "first format string %s\0"
.filename_1 "second_file.cpp\0"
.format_1 "second format string %s\0"
*/
----

Access to this elf section is possible via the following code;
[source,C,linenums]
----
extern const void __start_my_section;
extern const void __stop_my_section;

const void *const begin = &__start_my_section;  // pointer to first address of my_section
const void *const end = &__stop_my_section;     // pointer to first address after my_section
----
---
=== caching process and thread id
Each call to `syscall(SYS_getpid)` and `syscall(SYS_gettid)` requires a context switch to kernel and therefore burdens a heavy overhead. To remove this context switch, pid (process id) and tid (thread id) should be cached. +
It's possible to detect if a code is executed inside a new thread with storage specifier `__thread` for tid and detect forking with `pthread_atfork`.

.cache for tid
[source,C,linenums]
----
__thread _Atomic uint32_t cached_tid = {0};
uint32_t get_thread_id()
{
    uint32_t value = atomic_load(&cached_tid);
    if (value)
        return value;
    value = (uint32_t)syscall(SYS_gettid);
    atomic_store(&cached_tid, value);
    return value;
}
----
Due to storage specifier `__thread` for `cached_tid` it is a different variable for each thread and is each time initialized with zero. Because the process with id zero it the idle thread this is never a valid process id for a usable process. Therefore, if process id is zero, a system call is executed to get the process id and stored as a atomic variable to prevent data race conditions.

.cache for pid
[source,C,linenums]
----
__thread _Atomic uint32_t cached_pid = {0};
uint32_t get_process_id()
{
    uint32_t value = atomic_load(&cached_pid);
    if (value)
        return value;
    value = (uint32_t)syscall(SYS_getpid);
    atomic_store(&cached_pid, value);
    return value;
}

void update_cache(void)
{
    uint32_t pid = (uint32_t)syscall(SYS_getpid);
    atomic_store(&cached_pid, pid);
    uint32_t tid = (uint32_t)syscall(SYS_gettid);
    atomic_store(&cached_tid, tid);
}

// at the begin of main or in a constructor
pthread_atfork(NULL, NULL, update_cache);
----
For pid it is mostly the same as for tid. But to detect an new process `pthread_atfork` is utilised to register a callback to be automatically called, inside the new thread, immediately after fork. 
---
=== clean up for locks
Some times a lock need to be freed in different places, depending on the program sequence. For example like this:

[source,C,linenums]
----
void foo(void)
{
    Obj obj = ...;
    get_lock(obj);
    auto data = read_data(obj);
    if(!data_valid(data))
    {
        release_lock(obj); // program path A
        return;
    }
    process_data(data);
    write_data(obj, data);
    release_lock(obj); // program path B
    return;
}
----
Code like this always enables a coding error by calling `release_lock` multiple times. A possible improvement for this 
is:
[source,C,linenums]
----
typedef struct {Obj* obj;} Lock;
void release_obj_lock(const Lock* lock)
{
    if(lock && lock->obj)
        release_lock(obj);
}
void foo(void)
{
    Obj obj = ...;
    const Lock lock __attribute__((cleanup(release_obj_lock))) = get_lock(obj);
    auto data = read_data(obj);
    if(!data_valid(data))
    {
        return; // program path A
    }
    process_data(data);
    write_data(obj, data);
    return; // program path B
}
----
The `cleanup` attribute adds a call to `release_obj_lock` to each place where variable `lock` goes out of scope. An the lock will be always, only once, released.

---
=== safely call a function only once in multiprocess and multithreading

[source,C,linenums]
----
void foo(void) {...}

static pthread_once_t init_once = PTHREAD_ONCE_INIT;
pthread_once(&init_once, foo);
----

== Some other Stuff
** each linkage unit, like executable, shared-library or dynamic-library, contains there own meta-sections foreach buffer

* use shared memory between applications and kernel.
** kernel only provides shared memory space, which is mapped into user-address-space
** serialize access to shared memory via https://linux.die.net/man/7/sem_overview[posix named-semaphore]
** one shared-memory-space for ringbuffer and arbitrary number of meta-buffer for this ringbuffer
